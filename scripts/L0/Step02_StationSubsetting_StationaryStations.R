### Step 02: Determine stationary stations.
### Overview: Take 'Raw Data' and subset based on inclusion criteria and data 
### subsetting needs. Do this prior to pairing weather data to Birdweather 
### stations. Outcome of this script is to determine those stations from the Raw
### Data files aggregated in the previous step (Step01) that are stationary.

## Clear workspace and clean up memory:
rm(list=ls())
gc(reset=TRUE)


## Load libraries:
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(move2)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)


## Read in data:
d <- read.csv("Data/ProcessedData/all.stations.Feb.18.26.csv")

### Step02 B: Subset Step 1
################################################################################

### SUBSET STEP 1: Omit traveling stations.

## What this step does: There is often some imprecision or 'jitter' in some of 
## the Birdweather Station GPS coordinates meant to represent the location of 
## the recording unit. This imprecision can cause the same 'Stationary' recording
## station to have different coordinates associated with it. Not only does this 
## jitter exist, but some sations are not stattionary and instead represent mobile
## recoridng units (e.g. those taken in a backpack with a moving hiker). This step
## differentiates between stationary and mobile Stations, keeps only stationary 
## ones, and centralizes any jittered GPS coordinates into one coordinate per unique 
## station. Identify stationary versus mobile stations.


#Pull out a list of unique Station names:
station.names <- unique(d$Station) #2895 Stations


#Produce a function to loop around each Station name and assess it's GPS coordinates
#ultimately this function will determine if Station should be considered 'mobile' or 
#'stationary' (with jittered points) based on clustering of GPS points for each unique 
#Station. If stationary, one summarized point that is the average of the jittered points 
#will be spit out of the function as that Station's coordinate:
evaluate.points <- function(name){
